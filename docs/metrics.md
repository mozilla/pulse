# Metrics

A summary of the metrics the Pulse add-on will record.


## Definitions

* **Survey**: a short survey collecting user sentiment and rationale.
* **Report**: a full payload of information, combining both survey and measured data.
* **Page**: the page from which the survey was intiated.
* **Session**: a group of one or more pages from the same hostname in a contiguous browsing session.


## Lifecycle

The Pulse lifecycle begins when one of two things happen:

1. The user is prompted to begin with a [`<notificationbox>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL/notificationbox).
2. The user initiates the process through a [WebExtension `pageAction`](https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pageAction).

The user is then presented with a short survey. Once submitted, it is augmented with information about the browser, page, and session. Once compiled, the report is sent to the Test Pilot add-on, which forwards it to [Unified Telemetry](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Unified_Telemetry) and [Ping Centre](https://github.com/mozilla/ping-centre) for analysis.

## Analysis


### Performance

The primary research question Pulse is trying to answer: at what threshold does performance impact a userâ€™s satisfaction? There are a number of interesting ways that this can be measured and analyzed, foremost a multivariate analysis of covariance to uncover which performance factors most affect user sentiment.

Some interesting questions that could be answered by such an analysis:

- At what point does page weight affect user satisfaction?
- How does an ad-blocker affect user satisfaction? What specifically does it do that makes users happy or unhappy?
- At what point do the number of add-ons affect user satisfaction and speed?
- On which sites do users report the most problems?
- To what extent can users perceive the impact of e10s and multiple content processes?


### Experiment Health

With a clear funnel and bounce/conversion definitions, the health

- Can users be compelled to report positive experiences as well as negative ones?
- How sticky is Pulse? How do conversion rates change over time?
- What types of prompts are most effective?

These analyses can inform more directed future studies (site-specific, users with specific add-ons, etc).


### Compatibility

Specific reports might be able to be passed on to the Web Compatability team for futher triage.


## Collection


### `pulse-prompted`

Fired whenever the user is prompted to provide feedback.


#### Payload properties

- `type`: string indicating why the user was prompted. See [Appendix A] for more information.


#### Example ping

```js
{
  "event": "pulse-prompted",
  "test": "pulse@mozilla.com",
  "version": "1.0.2",

  // Added by the Test Pilot metrics broker. Not currently relevant.
  "object": null,
  "category": "interactions",
  "variant": null,
  "variants": null,
  "timestamp": 76543,

  "type": "random"
}
```


### `pulse-dismissed`

Fired whenever the user dismisses a feedback prompt.


#### Payload properties

- `type`: string indicating why the user was prompted. See [Appendix A] for more information.


#### Example ping

```js
{
  "event": "pulse-dismissed",
  "test": "pulse@mozilla.com",

### `pulse-loaded`

Fired whenever the survey is opened, whether in a tab or page action doorhanger. After `pulse-loaded` is fired, will be followed by either `pulse-unloaded` (i.e. a bounce) or `pulse-submitted` (i.e. a conversion).


#### Payload properties

- `type`: string indicating why the user was prompted. See [Appendix A] for more information.
- `id`: string containing a [v4 UUID] for the submission. The same ID will be included with the resultant `pulse-unloaded` or `pulse-submitted` ping.


#### Example ping

```js
{

  "test": "pulse@mozilla.com",
  "version": "1.0.2",

  // Added by the Test Pilot metrics broker. Not currently relevant.
  "object": null,

```


### `pulse-unloaded`

Fired whenever the survey is closed without being submitted.


#### Payload properties

- `type`: string indicating why the user was prompted. See [Appendix A] for more information.
- `id`: string containing a [v4 UUID] for the submission. The ID will be identical to the preceding `pulse-loaded` ping.


#### Example ping

```js
{
  "event": "pulse-unloaded",
  "test": "pulse@mozilla.com",
  "version": "1.0.2",

  // Added by the Test Pilot metrics broker. Not currently relevant.
  "object": null,

  "timestamp": 76543,

  "id": "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee",
  "type": "random"
}
```


### `pulse-submitted`

Fired upon successful submission of the survey containing the survey data augmented with data gathered about the browser, page, and session.


#### Payload properties

- `type`: string indicating why the user was prompted. See [Appendix A] for more information.
- `id`: string containing a [v4 UUID] for the submission. The ID will be identical to the preceding `pulse-loaded` ping.
- `sentiment`: number indicating the user's feeling about the current page, scored on a five-point Likert scale, i.e. between `1` and `5`, inclusive.
- `reason`: string indicating the reason the user feels the way they indicated in the `sentiment`. Possible values tentatively `fast`, `slow`, `works`, `broken`, `like`, `dislike`, and `other`.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Types

Each ping contains a `type` field indicating the action precipitating the entrance to the feedback funnel. This is always a string, and will be one of the following values:

- `user`: user-initiated feedback, started by clicking the pulse icon in the page action.
- `random`: users are randomly prompted to provide feedback no more than once per day.

This list is not exhaustive; more directed studies will be added as the experiment progresses. Unless otherwise specified, this prompting happens in a high-priority [`<notificationbox`](//developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL/notificationbox) element.


### Appendix B: Ad-blockers

In some properties, Pulse attempts to determine if the user has installed an ad-blocker. This is determined by comparing against [a list](https://github.com/mozilla/pulse/blob/master/src/measurements/ad-blocker.js) of add-ons from the AMO 'Security and Privacy' category with more than 25,000 users. This list is not considered exhaustive.

Additionally, the Test Pilot [Tracking Protection](https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/tracking-protection) experiment is considered to be an ad-blocking extension.


### Appendix C: Engagement

A normalized score tracking a user's engagement to the page; specifics are to be determined, but this will likely be similar to the [Chromium Site Engagement](//www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/site-engagement) metric. Number, between `0.0` and `100.0`.


### Appendix D: Aggregated Properties

To provide more insight into numbers aggregated across multiple pages, some fields are reported as an object containing the count, sum, mean, number of null values, and decile partitions, e.g.

```json
{
    "num": 125,
    "total": 151304,
    "mean": 1210.432,
    "deciles": [ 224, 536, 766, 972, 1297, 1457, 1731, 2076, 2353 ],
    "null": 3
}
```

If there are fewer than 10 items in the session, the raw data is reported in lieu of `deciles`.
